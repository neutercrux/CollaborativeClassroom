## Project Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a collaborative interface for the use of students and teachers
during an offline lecture that involves developing code on the fly as part of the teaching process. This
solution addresses issues like the redundancy of copying code from the display to make relevant notes
and comments during a lecture. The interface developed is independent of a connection to the internet.
Features such as annotations and a doubts section enable an increase in efficiency and a reduction in
unwanted overheads. The provision of downloadable content ensures better documentation of the
lecture for future context and reference. This interface is designed as a standalone application that aims
to aid offline lectures, it does not intend to replace them at all.

## Code Execution
